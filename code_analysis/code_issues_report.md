# Code Issues Analysis Report

## Issues Found:

### 1. Props Interface Mismatch in ChampionGrid
**File:** `src/components/ChampionGrid.tsx`
**Issue:** Props interface doesn't match actual usage in `src/app/page.tsx`
- Interface expects `selectedChampion` but code passes `selectedChampionId`
- This causes TypeScript errors and potential runtime issues

### 2. Missing ScrollArea Implementation
**Issue:** Main content areas don't use the custom ScrollArea component
- Champion grid and skin grid have basic overflow without custom styling
- Missing smooth scroll behavior

### 3. Loading State Inconsistencies
**Issue:** Different loading components with varying quality
- Some use basic skeletons, others have elaborate animations
- No consistent loading pattern across components

### 4. Image Loading Issues
**Issue:** Potential issues with image loading and fallbacks
- BlurDataURL uses static placeholder that may not exist
- No proper error handling for failed image loads

### 5. Performance Issues
**Issue:** Potential memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders
- Heavy components not properly memoized
- Large datasets could cause performance issues

### 6. Missing Error Boundaries
**Issue:** No proper error boundary implementation for component failures

### 7. Accessibility Issues
**Issue:** Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- No focus management for champion selection
- Missing screen reader support

## Priority Fixes:
1. Fix props interface mismatch (CRITICAL)
2. Implement proper scroll areas (HIGH)
3. Enhance loading states (HIGH)
4. Add error boundaries (MEDIUM)
5. Improve accessibility (MEDIUM)
6. Performance optimizations (LOW)
